## Gorilla

Gorilla is designed for use on the Bitcoin Mini and built on Node.js but should work with any Linux/Bitcoin Core/Nodejs setup.  However no support is implied in making this code available.

Visit our website and order one today [BitcoinMini.com](https://bitcoinmini.com/).

## Installation

**Please note that the installation is based on the exact file structure on the Mini**
If you don't use this file structure config.json contents will be deleted with error [This needs to be fixed before use.  There is no reason to default to overwrite on error]

    // file structure
    <root dir / >
    |_ home
    	|_ user home folder
        	|_ .bitcoin
        	|_ Gorilla-UI


Load the npm dependencies:

`npm install`


Run:

`node guerilla`

or

`pm2 start guerilla -i 0`

## Setup

Find the internal IP address by logging into your router and finding the device on the network. More detailed directions can easily be found on the internet.

There is a disabled by default system to have the Mini email you the ip address but this is not recommended. Most routers are fairly easy to access with the use of web search for the model.


### Security

You are responsible for understanding the ramifications of opening ports on your internet connection.  Please contact us with any questions.

## The Bitcoin Mini

Gorilla is designed to run on the Bitcoin Mini. Every piece of software was chosen for it's small and powerful nature to reduce the overall footprint of the Mini while keeping it fast and effienct.

All Minis come with [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) as it's operating system and Bitcoin Core installed with the approximately 52GB of blockchain data downloaded.
